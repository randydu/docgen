This section explains how to upgrade from old versions of DocGen.

DocGen 1.0.* to DocGen 2.0.0
----------------------------

DocGen 2 is not backwards compatible with DocGen 1, but the upgrade is easy with these instructions:

- Install DocGen 2 by following the [installation guide](installation.html)
- Create a replacement 'source' directory, e.g: **<code>docgen scaffold -o $HOME/source</code>**
- Migrate the source files
	- Copy the source (.txt) files from the old 'Src' directory to the new 'source' directory
	- Remove the top-level page headings in each source file (DocGen now inserts these automatically, based on contents.json)
	- Rename *'change-log.txt'* to *'release-notes.txt'*
- Migrate the attached content
	- Place a logo with filename 'logo.png' in 'files/images' directory (the logo is now part of the source)
	- Copy the images from *'Images'* to *'files/images'*
	- Copy attached files from *'Files'* to *'files'*
- Migrate the metadata
	- Edit *'parameters.json'* with the relevant values from *'doc-parameters.yml'*
	- Edit *'contents.json'* with the relevant values from *'table-of-contents.yml'*
- Run DocGen: **<code>docgen -i $HOME/source -o $HOME/output</code>**
- Check the styling in the latest version still works well with the old content
- Note that the PDF is no longer generated by default (pass the *'-p'* option)

> DocGen 1 tool-behaviours.yml has been replaced by command-line options. For help, see **<code>docgen run -h</code>**.
