Overview
--------

DocGen is a command-line tool which takes plain text input files and outputs a static website.

Command-line usage
------------------

The DocGen command-line interface includes usage help for both the tool and its subcommands:

	docgen --help
	docgen run --help

Scaffold command
----------------

The **scaffold** command creates an *example* input directory. It outputs the minumum files required by DocGen, which 
can then be used as a template for making any new website.

**Create a scaffold template in the working directory** (./)**:**

	docgen scaffold

**Create a scaffold template in a specified directory:**

	docgen scaffold -o $HOME/docgen-example

Run command
-----------

The **run** command transforms an input directory (plain text source) into an output directory (HTML+PDF).

**Basic usage:**

	docgen run -i $HOME/docgen-example -o $HOME/docgen-output

**Optionally create a PDF:**

	docgen run -i $HOME/docgen-example -o $HOME/docgen-output -p

**Optionally create a redirect page:**

	docgen run -i $HOME/docgen-example -o $HOME/docgen-output -r

> The optional redirect page is an 'index.html' file that is placed in the output's parent directory. The redirect page
redirects the user to the homepage in the output directory. This is mostly useful for hosting the website without having
to place all the files in the root directory.
